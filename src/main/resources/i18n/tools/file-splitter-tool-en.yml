  Split text files (markdown, code, HTML, etc.) into smaller pieces. This tool helps break down
  large text files into manageable chunks while preserving content completeness.

  Important: Files are read from rootPlanId/shared/ directory, same as GlobalFileOperator and
  MarkdownConverterTool. For example, to split rootPlanId/shared/projects.md, use file_path "projects.md".

  Supported operations:
  - split: Split a file into 10 smaller pieces (as evenly as possible by lines)
    Parameters: file_path (required, relative to rootPlanId/shared/), header (optional - text to add at the beginning of each split file)
    Output files are saved in the same directory as the source file, named with index prefix: 0-filename.ext, 1-filename.ext, etc.
  - count: Count total lines and character size of a file
    Parameters: file_path (required, relative to rootPlanId/shared/)

  Features:
  - Splits files by lines to ensure content completeness
  - Distributes lines as evenly as possible across 10 pieces
  - Adds optional header to each split file
  - Adds index number prefix to split file names (0-, 1-, 2-, etc.)
  - Supports text file formats: markdown, code files, HTML, configuration files, etc.
  - Files are read from and written to rootPlanId/shared/ directory

  Supported file types:
  - Text files (.txt, .md, .markdown)
  - Programming files (.java, .py, .js, .ts, .cpp, .c, .h, .go, .rs, .php, .rb, .swift, .kt, .scala)
  - Web files (.html, .htm, .mhtml, .css, .scss, .sass, .less)
  - Configuration files (.json, .xml, .yaml, .yml, .properties, .conf, .ini)
  - Scripts (.sql, .sh, .bat, .cmd)
  - Build tools (.gradle, .pom, .mvn)
  - Documentation (.csv, .rst, .adoc)
  - Logs (.log)
